# horizon

A tiny landscape painting that lives in your Claude Code statusline.

(render it in color: `cargo run --release -- --gallery`)

## What you're looking at

- **The sky is your clock.** The palette interpolates through ten keyframes of
  your real local time — indigo night, violet pre-dawn, orange sunrise, blue
  noon, amber golden hour, crimson sunset, purple dusk. Work at 6 a.m. and
  you'll watch the dawn come up in your terminal.
- **The moon is real.** Night scenes show the actual current lunar phase
  (○ ◔ ◐ ◕ ●), computed astronomically. Stars only come out when the sky is
  dark enough, and they resettle each day.
- **The mountains are yours.** The ridge is grown deterministically from a
  hash of your project path and git branch. Every project — and every branch —
  has its own skyline. You'll learn to recognize where you are by the shape of
  the land.
- **The sun is your context window.** The sun (or moon) travels across the
  ridge as your context fills, trailing a bloom of light that tints the sky
  around it. When it sets behind the right edge, your day is done: time to
  `/compact`.
- The quiet part on the right: directory, branch, model, context %, session
  cost, session time, lines added/removed — in colors matched to the hour.

## Install

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Then in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "/path/to/statusline/target/release/statusline"
  }
}
```

Renders in under a millisecond. Requires a terminal with 24-bit color
(anything modern).

## Context sources

Context usage is read from the statusline JSON's context fields when the
running Claude Code version provides them, otherwise from the last usage
entry in the session transcript, against a 200k window.

## Knobs (mostly for previews)

| env | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `HORIZON_HOUR=19.2` | override the local time |
| `HORIZON_CTX=85` | override context % |
| `HORIZON_SEED=proj:branch` | override the gallery's ridge seed |
